# Lead-Scoring
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. We have to assign score 0 to 100 to each 
lead. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the 
lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.


Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. For example, if, say, they acquire 100 leads 
in a day, only about 30 of them are converted. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most 
potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go 
up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.
